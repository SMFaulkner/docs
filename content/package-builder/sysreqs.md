To make sure system requirements are met for your package,

* Put the information in the `SystemRequirements` of `DESCRIPTION`.
* Make sure the system requirements are matched by [`sysreqsdb`](https://github.com/r-hub/sysreqsdb/#sysreqs). If not, [contribute to `sysreqsdb`](https://github.com/r-hub/sysreqsdb/#contributing).

If you think there's an issue with one R-hub platform regarding your package's system requirements, [get in touch](#about-r-hub-in-particular).
