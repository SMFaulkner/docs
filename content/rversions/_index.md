R-hub maintains the [`rversions` CRAN package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rversions) that queries the main R SVN repository to 

* find the versions r-release and r-oldrel refer to, 

* and also all previous R versions, their release dates and nicknames. 

For more information, refer to the [package docs](https://r-hub.github.io/rversions) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/r-hub/rversions).
