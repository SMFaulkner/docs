[R-hub Linux images](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub-linux-builders#rhub-linux-builders) are available [on Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/rhub), and [their source is open, on GitHub](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub-linux-builders). 
You can debug locally for Linux platforms, with R-hub Docker containers, no matter your operating system, granted you were able to install Docker itself. The `rhub` package provides some [helpers facilitating the use of R-hub Linux images](https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/articles/local-debugging.html).
